# Heat-transfer-time-calculation

This script calculates time taken from an initial temperature to two final temperatures (originally meant to establish a range) by heat transfer through conduction.
Original use was to calculate time taken for temperature change in liquid in a coffee cup. Parameters needed for the calculation should be specified.
